## Viewing the Infographic

The easiest way to view the infographic is by opening the `index.html` file in a web browser.

Alternatively, for a more production-like viewing experience, you can run a simple local web server:

1.  **Ensure Node.js is installed.** If not, you can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
2.  **Open your terminal or command prompt.**
3.  **Navigate to the project folder.**
4.  **Install project dependencies (if this is your first time running it):**

bash

- `npm install`

5.  **Start the local server:**


bash 

- `npm start`

6.  **Open your web browser** and go to the address provided in the terminal output (typically `http://localhost:3000`).

## Technology Used

*   **HTML:** For the structure and content of the infographic.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework used for styling and layout.
*   **Node.js & npm:** Used to run a simple local web server for viewing the static site.
